1. Upgradable contract. 

2. Minting and burning of ZAI using Ether. 3% above or below an oracle pricefeed, such that the contract only acts on recent price feeds and then closes the burning/minting of ZAI. 

3. A means to pull the Ether out, sell it and keep ZAR in reserves to later feed to the burner/minter again. This also allows the backing bank account to be kept secret.

4. Since the contract is upgradable, the idea is to move it to an algorithmic token later on or a Maker like CDP system.

5. Include native meta transaction. This allows people to use it directly on Ethereum without Ether.

6. Spin up a PoA sidechain for ZAI and port DAIHard.Exchange and the burner wallet.
